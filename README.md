Assignment1: 

Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to set up and use the tools for this course.
Directions
In this assignment, you will accomplish the following:
1. Setup R
2. Setup RStudio
3. Setup a github account
If you planning on using python, then do the following:
1. Setup Python (either as a local environment or as a jupyter notebook). For the local environment, I would recommend Anaconda. For a cloud based setup, use Google Colab.
2. Setup a github account
This assignment will concentrate on using R and Git. Specifically, you will do the following:
1. Download a dataset from the web. You may use any source, but specify the source in your code. Also ensure that the data has a mix of quantitative and qualitative (categorical) variables.
2. Import the dataset into R
3. Print out descriptive statistics for a selection of quantitative and categorical variables.
4. Transform at least one variable. It doesn't matter what the transformation is.
5. Plot at least one quantitative variable, and one scatterplot
6. Upload your R program, and any associated datafiles to your git account. Remember to create a separate repository for this class.
7. Paste the address to your repository in the assignment submission box here in Canvas.
Learning Outcomes
CLO 4: Know how to use software tools (such as R) effectively to implement machine learning algorithms for data mining/visualization and analytics
